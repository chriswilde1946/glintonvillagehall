<p style="text-align: center">WELCOME TO GLINTON VILLAGE HALL</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A GREAT VENUE IN A GREAT LOCATION</p>

Glinton Village Hall is the ideal venue for private parties, meetings, fund raising events, rehearsal space and various classes.<br /> 
There are 2 halls: the [**main hall**](/photos/Main Hall.jpg) and the [**small hall**](/photos/Small Hall.jpg). They are divided by an acoustic wall which enables the halls to be used separately or, by folding back the wall, both halls can be used together.<br />
