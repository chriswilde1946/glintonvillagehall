In 1980 the former Methodist chapel was converted into a village hall. It is very well used by everyone from pre-school children to senior citizens and is managed by the Glinton Community Association. 
It comprises:

* A foldable screen separates the two halls and the combined area of both halls 82 sq.m

* Total maximum capacity for the 2 halls is:

	100  people standing

	80   people sitting in rows 
	
	60   people sitting at tables
